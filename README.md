# Test API

## About
This repository houses an API that allows the user to create, read, list, update, and delete objects called Widget's from a local SQLite databse. All instructions are written assuming the user has access to a terminal and a bash shell or something comparable. The download commands assume the user has the Aptitude package manager. This document also assumes that your machine has Python version 3.8 or higher installed as most OS's ship with Python installed.

<br>

## Prerequisites
### Pip - The Python Package Installer

The Test API relies on a few libraries to function properly. To install these libraries, we need to leverage a tool called Pip. Install pip with the following command:

`sudo apt install python3-pip`
<br>


### SQLite 
Most modern operating systems ship with SQLite installed, but if you don't have it, you can install it with the following command:

`sudo apt install sqlite`

<br>

## Installation
It is recommended to use a virtual environment so as not to clutter your machine with dependencies after you're done using this API. For information on how to do that, click [HERE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

<br>

Next, clone the repository to your machine. See [HERE](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for instructions on how to do that.
